# evolve the spacecraft's landing path on complex land figure
GA project for INFO6205

Our Problem describles how spacecrafts making successful landing on a complex land figure.

The best landers are selected and used to create new landers.The problem is solved by using optimum speeds for maximizing the fuel efficiency using GA due to which eventually the landers slowly get better and start landing in the safe zone.
